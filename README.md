# mm_string_dict

[![CI](https://github.com/Mojo-Mania/mm_string_dict/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Mojo-Mania/mm_string_dict/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A hash map from string keys to arbitrary values for
[Mojo](https://mojolang.org), with the keys stored compactly.

The keys do not live in individual `String`s. They are appended end to end into
one byte buffer, with a parallel array of end offsets, so a key costs its bytes
plus one offset — no per-key header, no per-key allocation. Lookups compare
against slices of that buffer.

The map itself is a Swiss table: open addressing over a power-of-two slot
array, with a **control byte** per slot holding either "empty", "deleted", or
seven bits of the key's hash. Those seven bits come from the opposite end of
the hash to the bits that choose the slot, so they are independent of it, and a
probe compares a whole group of them at once — `simd_width_of[uint8]()` slots
per instruction, which is 16 with NEON and 32 with AVX2.

```mojo
from mm_string_dict import StringDict

var counts = StringDict[Int]()
counts["apple"] = 1
counts["pear"] = 2

print(counts["apple"])          # 1, raises if absent
print(counts.get("plum", 0))    # 0, the default
print("pear" in counts)         # True
print(len(counts))              # 2

for entry in counts.items():
    print(entry.key, entry.value)
```

The surface mirrors the stdlib `Dict` where it can, so swapping one for the
other is mostly mechanical.

## Install

```bash
pixi add --git https://github.com/Mojo-Mania/mm_string_dict.git mm_string_dict
```

Needs `preview = ["pixi-build"]` in the consuming workspace and pixi 0.80+.
Or vendor the `mm_string_dict/` directory and compile with
`mojo -I path/to/mm_string_dict`.

## Usage

Counting words, with `upsert` so the key is only looked up once:

```mojo
var counts = StringDict[Int]()

def bump(value: Optional[Int]) -> Int:
    return value.value() + 1 if value else 1

for word in text.split(" "):
    counts.upsert(word, bump)
```

Four compile-time parameters trade memory for capability:

```mojo
StringDict[Int]                                       # the defaults
StringDict[Int, DType.uint16]                         # ≤65535 entries, half the slot array
StringDict[Int, DType.uint32, DType.uint16]           # ≤64KB of keys in total
StringDict[Int, DType.uint32, DType.uint32, False]    # no delete, no tombstone bitmap
StringDict[Int, DType.uint32, DType.uint32, True, True]   # cache full hashes too
```

| Parameter | Default | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `V` | — | The value type; anything copyable. |
| `KeyCountType` | `uint32` | Indexes keys and slots, so it caps the entry count. |
| `KeyOffsetType` | `uint32` | Holds key end offsets, so it caps the **total** size of all keys. |
| `destructive` | `True` | One bit per entry for the tombstone mask. Off means `delete` does nothing. |
| `caching_hashes` | `False` | `KeyCountType` bytes per slot for a second filter after the control byte. Off by default: the tag already rejects 127 of every 128 non-matching slots, so it buys a few percent on lookups and costs the memory this container exists to save. |

## API

| Member | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `dict[key]` | The value, raising if the key is absent or deleted. |
| `dict[key] = value` | Insert, or replace the value if the key is there. |
| `get(key, default) -> V` | The value, or `default` when absent or deleted. |
| `key in dict`, `len(dict)`, `Bool(dict)` | Membership, entry count, emptiness. |
| `pop(key) -> V` | Remove and return, raising if absent. |
| `pop(key, default) -> V` | Remove and return, or `default`. |
| `setdefault(key, default) -> V` | The value, inserting `default` first if absent. |
| `update(other)` | Insert every live entry of `other`, replacing collisions. |
| `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `for key in dict` | Iterate live entries in insertion order. `values()` yields references; `items()` yields `.key` and `.value`. |
| `upsert(key, update)` | Insert or update with a function of the current value, looking the key up once. |
| `clear()` | Drop every entry, keep the storage. |
| `key_bytes()`, `print_keys()` | Inspect the packed key buffer. |

`put`, `get` and `delete` are the original names and still work; `__setitem__`,
`__getitem__` and `pop` are the `Dict`-shaped spellings of the same operations.

## Performance

20000 entries of 12 random characters, Apple M-series, release build
(`-D ASSERT=none`, which is what `pixi run bench` passes). Nanoseconds per
operation, lower is better.

| Operation | StringDict | stdlib `Dict[String, Int]` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lookup, present | **14.9** | 15.1 |
| membership, absent | **3.2** | 3.5 |
| membership, absent, table at 85% load | **3.8** | 3.4 |
| build | 19.5 | **16.8** |

Lookups are now level with the stdlib `Dict`, and the high-load case — the one
that used to fall apart — holds up: before the control byte, a miss at 85% load
walked 24 slots on average and up to 468, because deleting never freed a slot
and linear probing clustered. Now a probe scans 16 slots per compare and stops
at the first group containing an empty one.

Inserts are still ~16% behind, which is where the remaining work is.

**Memory is the reason to reach for this.** 20000 twelve-byte keys are 240000
bytes; the container holds them in 283702 bytes of buffer plus 80000 bytes of
offsets — about 1.5 bytes of overhead per key. A `Dict[String, Int]` stores a
`String` per entry instead: 24 bytes of header each before any of its bytes,
and a separate allocation once a key outgrows the inline buffer. The slot table
costs 5 bytes per slot (1 control byte + 4 index), down from 8 before the
control byte replaced the cached hash.

A note on the benchmark suite: it runs everything in one process, and a
benchmark's allocator state carries into the next, which moves the build
figures by a few nanoseconds either way. The build numbers above were taken one
variant per process.

## Development

```bash
pixi run test     # the test suite (42 tests)
pixi run bench    # the benchmarks above
pixi run main     # the example
pixi run format   # mojo format
pixi run docs     # docstring check
pixi build        # build the conda package (needs pixi >= 0.80)

## Provenance

This is Maxim Zaks' `StringDict`, which also lives in the Mojo standard
library's benchmark suite. Packaged here as a library, with tests, benchmarks,
a `Dict`-shaped API, and three bug fixes — see
